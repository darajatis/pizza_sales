# Pizza Sales Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes pizza sales data to uncover sales trends, customer purchasing behavior, and product performance insights.
The project is implemented in **two versions**, each producing nearly similar dashboards but using different analytics and visualization tools. This approach demonstrates flexibility in data workflows and the ability to deliver consistent insights using multiple technologies.

* **Version 1:** SQL Server (SSMS) + Excel
* **Version 2:** SQL Server (SSMS) + Power BI

The main objective is to showcase end-to-end data analytics skills, from database creation and SQL querying to data analysis and dashboard visualization.
